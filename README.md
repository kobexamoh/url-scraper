# Design URL Scraper

A URL scraper for making mockups with real content on work sites.

## Heads up: this is a WIP and only works for certain pages currently as a precursor to wireframing. It's a very specific use case and will (probably) not work for your needs. Do not use it for your work unless you know what you're doing!

## 📝 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Lint your code

## 🔧 Customization

### Modifying Tailwind Configuration

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize:
- Colour schemes
- Font families
- Container settings
- Animations
- Other theme extensions

### Environment Variables
